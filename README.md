# Happy Thoughts

This week assignment was to create a "Twitter-similar" site and practice our React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

We worked with a Happy Thoughts API which showcases previously posted thoughts, gives us the possibility to post new thoughts and also give likes to the already existing ones.

## The problem

Criterias:
✓ The page should follow a predefined design as closely as possible
✓ You should list the most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom (sorted)
✓ Your thoughts should show the content of the message and how many likes they've received
✓ You should have a form to post new thoughts
✓ You should implement the heart button to send likes on a thought
